  Very incomplete list of known bugs in Aptitude
  (doesn't count missing features)

 * When viewing a tree with a visible root (for example, a package information
  screen), pressing "End" will somehow confuse the system into thinking that
  it's not possible to select the root item -- or indeed, even see it!
  Pressing Home again will solve the problem.

 * The internal pager gets confused if you scroll left or right while viewing
  a file that contains tabs.

 * When downloading files, "Connecting to ..." and "Waiting for file" messages
  are not displayed, some errors are lost, and various other weird things
  happen.  This is due to a flaw either in the libapt interface or in my
  understanding of how it's supposed to work ;-)  What *should* happen is that
  these messages should appear until an item is hit, fails, or starts
  downloading, and that they should then be replaced by the progress indicator
  for that item.  The problem, at least for some of these bugs, is that I can't
  always figure out which worker reported an event.
   (the download_bar avoids most of these peoblems, but "Waiting for file"
    appears to be MIA..OTOH, it could be that my connection is so fast that
    I never see it anyway :) )

 * Also when downloading files, the screen should automagically scroll
  downwards as more items are added.
